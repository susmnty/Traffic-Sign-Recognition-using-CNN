# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-using-CNN
A deep learning-based traffic sign classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras. This project helps autonomous driving systems detect and classify road signs with high accuracy.

# Objective
The Traffic Sign Recognition System enhances road safety by accurately classifying road signs from images. This is crucial for self-driving vehicles and intelligent traffic management systems.

# Project Overview

This project is divided into four major components:

1. **Data Collection (`data_collection.py`)** ‚Äì Collects traffic sign images for training.

2. **Data Preprocessing (`data_preprocessing.py`)** ‚Äì Normalizes, resizes, and augments images.

3. **Model Training (`train_model.py`)** ‚Äì Trains a CNN model for traffic sign classification.

4. **Visualization (`visualization.py`)** ‚Äì Generates graphs and visual representations of model predictions.
